Data exploration framework

## Manifesto

- Zero bootstrap
- Can be plugged into any other framework
- Everything is a widget
- Widgets are oblivious of ancestors
- The state of a widget can be serialized at any given point in time
- Any widget configuration can be represented by a URI
- Widgets can implement any data mechanism

## Running

```bash
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/gulp
```
